## Polygon Shape Calculator

### Assignment

In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

#### Rectangle class
When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with `width` and `height` attributes. The class should also contain the following methods:
* `set_width`
* `set_height`
* `get_area`: Returns area (`width * height`)
* `get_perimeter`: Returns perimeter (`2 * width + 2 * height`)
* `get_diagonal`: Returns diagonal (`(width ** 2 + height ** 2) ** .5`)
* `get_picture`: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of "\*". The number of lines should be equal to the height and the number of "\*" in each line should be equal to the width. There should be a new line (`\n`) at the end of each line. If the width or height is larger than 50, this should return the string: "Too big for picture.".
* `get_amount_inside`: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. Returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4.

Additionally, if an instance of a Rectangle is represented as a string, it should look like: `Rectangle(width=5, height=10)`

## Time Calculator

### Assignment

Write a function named `add_time` that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
* a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM) 
* a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
* (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive

The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

If the result will be the next day, it should show `(next day)` after the time. If the result will be more than one day later, it should show `(n days later)` after the time, where "n" is the number of days later.
